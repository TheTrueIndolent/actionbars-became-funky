### Title: Actionbars Became Funky
### Addon - Script
### Game: World of Warcraft

Actionbars Became Funky (ABF) is an add on that enchants the default action bars!

You can open the options panel in three ways:
1. With the commands: /abf and /actionbarbecamefunky.
2. Through the game menu. Game Menu (Esc) --> Options --> AddOns.
3. Through the minimap buttons that Blizzard gave us. Itâ€™s a tiny number at the top-left or bottom-left of the minimap, click it and you will find it.

Right now, ABF can:
- Place an slot art to buttons of an action bar!
- Place an artwork/texture at the edge of an action bar (like Gryphons, Wyverns, Dragons, etc)!
- Place an artwork/texture at the top of an action bar!
- Place an artwork/texture at the bottom of an action bar!
- Make some of those artworks/textures interactive, play a small animation when you start the combat and during the combat!
- You can create, load, and delete a profile so you can copy/paste your settings between your characters!
